# Celsius to Farenheit

this program use a Windows system call, I don't know if also works in Linux.

to run this code you will need a C++ compiler (like g++ or clang, in my case I use g++).

First, run this command 
```
g++ app.cpp -o nameofthefile.exe
```

and then run the program using:

```
With Windows Powershell: ./nameofthefile.exe
```

```
With cmd: nameofthefile.exe
```
